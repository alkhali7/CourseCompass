## Overview
Course Compass is an innovative web-based application designed to simplify and enhance the academic experience for Michigan State University (MSU) students. It serves as an all-encompassing academic navigator that integrates with the D2L Brightspace API to provide a consolidated view of students' schedules, coursework, and deadlines.

## Inspiration
The concept for Course Compass was driven by the need for a more streamlined and efficient way for MSU students to manage their academic calendars, assignments, and communication with peers and instructors through a single interface.

## Features
- **Academic Dashboard**: Aggregates and displays daily schedules and coursework from D2L.
- **Intelligent To-Do List**: Prioritizes tasks and rolls over incomplete assignments to ensure students remain on track.
- **Prototype Interface**: Showcases the core functionalities with mock data structured in JSON to represent an example student's schedule.

## How It Works
Course Compass is currently in its prototype stage, using custom data to build daily to-do lists and calendars by synchronizing with manually curated assignment and course data. The user interface is designed to be intuitive, engaging, and accessible, providing a coherent academic management experience.

## Project Structure
- `app.js`: Main application script that sets up the server and API endpoints.
- `assignments.json`: Mock data representing students' assignments, used for the prototype.
- `courses.json`: Mock data simulating the course structures and schedules.
- `index.html`: The entry point of the application, containing the HTML structure.
- `script.js`: Frontend JavaScript that handles the dynamic rendering of tasks and schedules.
- `style.css`: Contains the styles for the web application, defining its aesthetic appeal.

## Challenges
Creating Course Compass involved overcoming the challenge of integrating various academic data sources without direct API access. This led to the development of a unique dataset that closely resembles actual academic structures.

## Accomplishments
We are proud to present Course Compass as a testament to innovation and an understanding of student needs. The platform has been crafted to be easy to use, connecting seamlessly with the academic framework of MSU.

## What We Learned
The development process taught us the importance of user-centered design, the intricacies of integrating academic systems, and the value of efficient data management. We've honed our skills in both front-end and back-end development through this project.

## What's Next
The future of Course Compass includes plans for:
- Enhanced analytics for study habits.
- Integration with additional academic resources.
- Expanded communication features for collaborative learning experiences.
